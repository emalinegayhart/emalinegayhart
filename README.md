# Hi, I'm Emaline ðŸ‘‹

My journey in tech began with the [**Marginalized Genders in Gaming**](https://cmgg.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) club at UC Berkeley, where I participated in their annual game jams and mentorship program. Through this program, I received mentorship from leadership & developers from top game studios, which sparked my interest in game development and interactive experiences. This led me to participate in [**Technica**](https://gotechnica.org/), the University of Maryland's hackathon for underrepresented genders in tech, which was such a great experience I was inspired to apply for software engineering internships as well.

### Side Projects

I'm currently exploring ways to blend gaming and machine learning to create uniquely personal gaming experiences. If you have experience or passion in this area, I would love to chat!

In my pinned projects you'll find my early game jam submissions & a real time subscription chat service for streamers. I've also contributed to open source projects in the past and am always on the look out for a fun one to join in on - if you have any recommendations, let me know!

I also host an intentionally inclusive & casual tech social called ["tech night!"](https://itstechnight.com) We have recently expanded to start hosting annual game jams, hackathons, and conference nights. 

Feel free to explore my projects and letâ€™s connect if you're interested in collaborating on creative tech and ML-driven projects. <3
