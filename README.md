# Hi, I'm Emaline ðŸ‘‹

My journey in tech began with the [**Marginalized Genders in Gaming**](https://cmgg.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) club at UC Berkeley, where I participated in their annual game jams and mentorship program. Through this program, I received mentorship from leadership & developers from top game studios, which sparked my interest in programming. This led me to participate in [**Technica**](https://gotechnica.org/), the University of Maryland's hackathon for underrepresented genders in tech, which was such a great experience I was inspired to apply for software engineering internships. I'm now on my second internship placement at Shopify.

In my pinned projects you'll find my early game jam submissions & a real time chat service for streamers using Websockets & Action Cable. I've also contributed to open source projects in the past and am always on the look out for a fun one to join in on - if you have any recommendations, let me know!
